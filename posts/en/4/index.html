In our first article, we explored its origins and the fundamentals of its process. Now, it’s time to dive deeper. In this piece, we’ll describe the key components that make Scrum so effective: the concept of User Stories, the rhythm of sprints shaped by ceremonies, and the pivotal role of the team. We’ll wrap up this series with a final article that reflects on the bigger picture and challenges of Scrum.</p>
<h2 id="finding-the-users-through-consumer-research-and-building-stories-around-them">Finding the Users through Consumer Research and building Stories around them</h2>
<div><p>In our previous article, we described Scrum as being a framework that works in <strong>short cycles</strong>, in which the team <strong>inspects</strong>, <strong>reflects</strong> and <strong>adapts regularly</strong> the workflow <strong>to achieve higher efficiency</strong>.</p><p>For that, Scrum requires a cultural shift. Instead of planning everything in advance, the idea behind Scrum is to <strong>deliver something of value as fast as possible to the client</strong>, to get first feedback and then build from it. And it all starts with understanding who your user is.</p></div>
<div><blockquote>
<p>“So before you prioritize what needs to be done for your business, you need to define the character, the user, the customer — <span style="color: tomato">the person who’s going to use what you’re going to do</span>. You need to know their <span style="color: tomato">likes, dislikes, passions, enthusiasms, frustrations, and joys</span>. And then you need to understand <span style="color: tomato">their motivations</span>. (…) Why do they need a car? (…) So the first thing you want to think about when you’re considering a task is <span style="color: tomato">character or role</span> — for example, a customer, a bride, a reader, an employee. Who is this task being done for? <span style="color: tomato">Whose lens on the world is the one we need to gaze through when we’re building this thing</span>, making that decision, or delivering this piece? <span style="color: tomato">Then</span> you need to think of the what — <span style="color: tomato">what we want done in the first place. This is usually where we start and stop</span>. But it’s only the middle of the process we should be following. (…) Finally, you need to think of motivation. (…) <span style="color: tomato"> How is it going to serve and delight this particular customer</span>? And, in a way, this is the key part. Motivation colors everything.”</p>
</blockquote></div>
<h2 id="the-user-story">The User Story</h2>
<div><p>Once you stepped into the shoes of your user, you create a product or a service that will meet their needs and decompose your project into small tasks representing each functionality of your application. In Scrum, each task is called a User Story, because:</p><blockquote>
<p>“People think in narratives, in stories. That’s how we understand the world. We have an intimate grasp of characters, desires, and motivations. Where we get into trouble is when we try to abstract out of the main through-line discrete parts and deal with them out of context.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Besides, when developing the functionality, the story you create will be a powerful tool for the developers to grasp the reality the user will be in:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Those stories are ones that a team can wrap its head around. A discussion can actually ensue about how to implement them. They’re specific enough to be actionable but don’t prescribe how they’re going to be done.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Each User Story (US) then represents the task from the user’s point of view. Each US needs to follow the INVEST acronym, that is, it must be Independent from the other US, Negotiable (not fixed at any given time), Valuable (meaning it adds value to the application), Estimable (meaning it can be estimated by the team), Small, and Testable.</p><p>A good example of a User Story might be: “As a shopper, I want to add products to a basket, so that I can review and manage the items I plan to purchase on a dedicated page.”</p></div>
<h2 id="the-sprint">The sprint</h2>
<div><p>Now that you have an idea of a product and functionalities described as User Stories, the most important thing in Scrum is to test these first ideas as soon as possible with a concrete application and get feedback from the users. For that, each working cycle is voluntarily short and is called a sprint. It lasts between 1 to 4 weeks maximum, and each sprint aims to produce something that brings the maximum value to the final product.</p><blockquote>
<p>“At the end of each Sprint, have something that’s done—something that can be used (to fly, drive, whatever).”</p>
</blockquote></div>
<h2 id="how-to-prioritize-the-backlog">How to prioritize the backlog</h2>
<div><p>Ok, now we have some User Stories prepared. But what do we start to develop first? For that, the answer lies in the question: what brings the most value to the project?</p><blockquote>
<p>“In software development there is a rule, borne out by decades of research, that <span style="color: tomato">80 percent of the value in any piece of software is in 20 percent of the features.</span> (…) The key is to figure out how to <span style="color: tomato">deliver the most value the most quickly</span>. There may be many millions of ways to arrange that Backlog (all the User Stories planned to make the product functional) (…) Your first guess for the first Sprint almost certainly won’t be the right one, but it will be your best guess at the time. But that’s just your first guess. After the first Sprint, once you’ve (…) delivered some product to customers, you’ll change that order, realizing that another arrangement is actually better. (…) The key is to acknowledge uncertainty, to fully accept that your current snapshot of order and value is only relevant at that one particular moment. It’ll change again. And again. And again.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Start thinking about how to focus on delivering the most valuable features of the application. That means aiming to develop the 20% that will generate 80% of your project’s value.</p></div>
<p>Then comes the question: Who decides which 20% is most important? The team does, during one of the key ceremonies in a sprint.</p>
<h2 id="the-important-role-played-by-the-ceremonies">The important role played by the ceremonies</h2>
<div><p>To channel the actions of the team, the sprint is organized around rituals and ceremonies that provide the tools for incremental development and continuous improvement. The first major ritual starting a cycle is the sprint planning.</p></div>
<h3 id="the-sprint-planning">The sprint planning</h3>
<div><p>At the start of each sprint, the team organizes a ritual called the sprint planning, during which they collectively decide what they believe they can achieve during the cycle. During this meeting, the Product Owner prioritizes tasks based on the value they bring to the project, and the team evaluates what can realistically be accomplished by the end of the sprint. A key aspect of Scrum is that the development team is autonomous in deciding how to execute the tasks, without direct intervention from a manager or an external party. While the participation of the Product Owner and Scrum Master is essential to align expectations, the development team remains responsible for the technical implementation and breaking down tasks into actionable items.</p><blockquote>
<p>“…It’s crucial, though, that you have the team who’s actually doing the work do the estimating, not some expert ‘ideal’ estimators. (…) Each (team) has its own pace and rhythm. Forcing them into cookie-cutter processes is a recipe for disaster.”</p>
</blockquote><p>During this part of the ceremony, the team discusses the difficulty of completing each User Story, using the poker planning method. In this method, everyone evaluates the task with difficulty points (e.g. 1, 3, 5, 8, 13…), and the vote is done anonymously to prevent group biases (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>bandwagon</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>halo</em></a> effects). Everyone’s votes are then revealed, and a discussion follows to understand why such a value has been chosen, to get a more accurate vision of the task.</p><p>The sprint then gets a certain number of points, which defines a central metric in Scrum: the <strong>velocity of the team during a cycle</strong>. Cycle after cycle, you get a better understanding of the velocity of the team.</p><blockquote>
<p>“Also once you have your velocity, you can figure out the most important thing in Scrum: what is keeping you from going faster? What is keeping you from accelerating?”</p>
</blockquote><p>In this part and in general in Scrum, the idea is to dare to “<em>Set Audacious Goals. With Scrum, it is not that hard to double production or cut delivery time in half</em>”.</p><p>After many sprints and continuous dialogue with the client, you have a better idea of the velocity the team. In return, it gives you a better idea of the delivery date to communicate for more important features.</p></div>
<p>Once the sprint planning is closed, another regular ritual is set: the daily Scrum.</p>
<h3 id="the-daily-scrum-or-stand-up">The daily Scrum or stand-up</h3>
<div><p>This ritual usually occurs every morning of the sprint. Its purpose is to review the previous day’s progress and identify any issues that need collective effort to ensure the sprint’s goals are met.</p><blockquote>
<p>“The Scrum Master, the person in charge of running the process, asks each team member three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What did you do yesterday to help the team finish the Sprint?</li>
<li>What will you do today to help the team finish the Sprint?</li>
<li>What obstacles are getting in the team’s way?”</li>
</ol>
</blockquote><p>It has nevertheless a few more rules:</p><ul>
<li>It is a short meeting, lasting a maximum of 15 minutes: we want it to be “<em>crisp, direct, and to the point.</em>”</li>
<li>It requires the active participation of everyone and energy:</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>“Passivity is not only lazy, it actively hurts the rest of the team’s performance. Once spotted, it needs to be eliminated immediately (…) I want aggressive teams — ones that come out of the daily meeting knowing the most important thing they need to accomplish that day. One person will hear another say that a task will take a day, but another team member might know how to do it in an hour if they work together. I want teams emerging from that meeting saying things like, <strong><span style="color: tomato">‘Let’s nail this. Let’s do this.</span></strong>’ The team needs to want to be <strong><span style="color: tomato">great.</span></strong>”</p>
</blockquote></div>
<h3 id="the-sprint-review-and-the-retrospective">The Sprint review and the Retrospective</h3>
<div><p>Finally, at the end of a sprint, a sprint review and a retrospective take place:</p><ul>
<li>The sprint review is to evaluate the progress made and see if the elements produced are aligned with the business expectations ([The What]).</li>
<li>The retrospective concentrates the effort on how the sprint went (good, bad), identifying eventual problems and seeing how they can perform better next sprint ([The How]).</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>“Ideally, at the end of each iteration, each Sprint, <span style="color: tomato">the team would look closely at itself</span> — at its interactions, practices, and processes—and ask two questions: ‘What can we change about how we work?’ and ‘<span style="color: tomato">What is our biggest sticking point</span>?’ If those questions are answered forthrightly, a team can go faster than anyone ever imagined. (…) The key thing to remember is that you’re <span style="color: tomato">not seeking someone to blame</span>; you’re <span style="color: tomato">looking at the process</span>. Why did that happen that way? Why did we miss that? What could make us faster? It is crucial that <span style="color: tomato">people as a team take responsibility for their process and outcomes</span>, and seek solutions as a team.”</p>
</blockquote></div>
<h2 id="a-certain-vision-of-the-team-and-hunting-wastes">A certain vision of the team and hunting “wastes”</h2>
<div><p>However, to achieve higher productivity, these rituals are not sufficient: some other prerequisites around the constitution of the team exist.</p></div>
<div><h3 id="the-team">The team</h3><p>It needs to be:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Built around an idea or a project that transcends the group</strong>, a purpose that makes the team solid and greater than the individual (like winning a championship trophy or rallying behind an important figure as the author).</li>
<li><strong>Cross-functional</strong>, that is, having all the required competences and resources to develop the project.</li>
<li><strong>Autonomous</strong>, meaning the team has the power to take action quickly.</li>
<li>Constituted of <strong>7 people max</strong> to work faster: more individuals might slow the process.</li>
<li>A team of <strong>individuals working closely</strong>, being able to <strong>meet frequently</strong>, and communicate to address issues collectively as soon as they arise:</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>“Getting everyone together in a room was key because it gave the team the opportunity to self-organize around challenges. If someone was stuck with a problem—if the accelerometer wasn’t talking to the altimeter—everyone saw that the impediment could block the whole Sprint, and they swarmed on it, making sure it got fixed pronto.”</p>
</blockquote><ul>
<li>Built around individuals who feel 100% concerned by the success of the team and do not have a specialized domain or specialized role:</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>“The thing that cripples communication saturation is specialization — the number of roles and titles in a group. <span style="color: tomato">If people have a special title, they tend to do only things that seem a match for that title</span>. And to protect the power of that role, they tend to hold on to specific knowledge. <span style="color: tomato">So we got rid of all titles.</span>”</p>
</blockquote><ul>
<li>Focused 100% on one project at the same time to minimize the cost of “context switching” that happens during multitasking:</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>“The idea is that when you juggle between many tasks or projects at the same time, you finally lose time and end up less productive because you lose context. What I want you to do, though, is be conscious of the cost of context switching. It’s very real, and you should try to minimize it.”</p>
</blockquote><ul>
<li>Trying to do things right the first time, tackling problems as soon as they emerge, and not later; otherwise, it will take longer to resolve them.</li>
</ul></div>
<h2 id="eliminating-wastes-that-hinder-productivity">Eliminating “wastes” that hinder productivity</h2>
<div><p>Another core elements of Scrum is the deep influence of the founder of the Toyota Production System (Taiichi Ohno). In particular, Jeff Sutherland borrows the concepts of <em>flow of production</em> and <em>waste</em> to build his framework:</p><blockquote>
<p>“That is, (according to Toyota management system) production should flow swiftly and calmly throughout the process, and, he said, one of management’s key tasks is to identify and remove impediments to that flow. Everything that stands in the way is waste.”</p>
</blockquote><p>In this context, some identified wastes can be:</p><ul>
<li>What Ohno calls <strong>overburden</strong>: All the things that consume the team’s energy while producing no concrete value for the project:</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>“It includes onerous company policies that get in the way, unnecessary reporting that has people filling out forms for the sake of filling out forms, and meaningless meetings that suck up time and don’t deliver any value.”</p>
</blockquote><p>Here, Sutherland borrows from Eastern philosophy the ideal of simplicity and the idea that, to be efficient, the team needs to get rid of everything that does not contribute to productivity. As a consequence, <strong>the documentation of a project needs to be as minimal as possible</strong>.</p></div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Setting absurd goals</strong>: While Scrum tends to set high standards, setting impossible objectives can be counterproductive (e.g., for the morale of the team).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Setting <strong>too high expectations</strong>: If the normal flow of working relies…</p>
</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>“…on regular heroic actions to make its deadlines, it can work momentarily in the short term. However, being constantly moving from one crisis to the next causes burnout, and it doesn’t allow for reasoned, continuous improvement as the team is not able to tackle fundamental problems of the project.”</p>
</blockquote><p>The true difficulty lies in finding a balance between improving productivity (velocity) and setting reasonable targets that allow team members to enjoy working in the team and capitalize on the long run.</p></div>
<div><ul>
<li>Seeing <strong>third-party interventions to modify the sprint or interrupt the workflow</strong>: This makes the team lose focus on the goals and impedes productivity.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>To eliminate these wastes and improve productivity, two roles have been created: the Scrum Master and the Product Owner.</p>
<h2 id="the-scrum-master-and-the-product-owner-as-agents-to-boost-the-productivity-of-the-development-team">The Scrum Master and the Product Owner as agents to boost the productivity of the Development Team</h2>
<h3 id="scrum-master-as-agent-to-remove-obstacles">Scrum Master as agent to remove obstacles</h3>
<div><p>An important role inside a team is the Scrum Master. The Scrum Master serves as a facilitator and coach for the Scrum Team. Their primary focus is on promoting and supporting Scrum practices, ensuring the team operates smoothly and eliminating impediments bothering the team.</p><blockquote>
<p>“So we set up this framework of Sprints and Daily Stand-up meetings and Reviews and Retrospectives, and I realized we needed someone whose job it was to make sure the process itself was effective. Not a manager — <span style="color: tomato">more of a servant-leader, something between a team captain and a coach</span>. (…) He or she would <span style="color: tomato">facilitate</span> all the meetings, make sure there was transparency, and, most important, <span style="color: tomato">help the team discover what was getting in their way</span>. The key part of that was to realize that often the impediments aren’t simply that the machine doesn’t work or that Jim in accounting is a jerk — it’s the process itself. It was the Scrum Master’s job to guide the team toward continuous improvement — to ask with regularity, ‘How can we do what we do better?’”</p>
</blockquote></div>
<div><p>To sum up, the key responsibilities of the Scrum Master include:</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Facilitating Scrum Events</strong>: Organizing and overseeing ceremonies like Sprint Planning, Daily Scrums, Sprint Reviews, and Retrospectives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Removing Impediments</strong>: Identifying and eliminating obstacles that hinder the team’s progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Guardian of the Processes</strong>: Educating the team and organization about Scrum principles and practices, ensuring adherence to the Scrum framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protecting the Team</strong>: Shielding the team from external distractions and interruptions, allowing them to focus on Sprint goals.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<h3 id="product-owner-po-as-conductor-and-business-head">Product Owner (PO) as Conductor and Business Head</h3>
<div><p>The Product Owner is responsible for the business side of the project: they represent the voice of the customer and stakeholders. POs are responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team.</p><blockquote>
<p>“What Scrum does, by delivering a working increment, is give the Product Owner the <span style="color: tomato">ability to see how much value that increment creates, how people react to it</span>. Then, based on that information, <span style="color: tomato">she can change what the team will do in the next Sprint</span>. This sets up a constant feedback cycle that accelerates innovation and adaptation and enables the Product Owner <span style="color: tomato">to measure how much value is delivered</span>. (…) The Product Owner thus has the ability to <span style="color: tomato">adjust</span> on the fly to a constantly changing world.”</p>
</blockquote></div>
<div><p>To sum up, the key responsibilities of the Product Owner include:</p><ul>
<li><strong>Managing the Product Backlog</strong> (list of all the items to do): Creating, maintaining, and prioritizing the backlog items based on customer needs, market trends, and business value.</li>
<li><strong>Clear Communication</strong>: Ensuring that the Development Team understands the backlog items to the level needed, facilitating clarity on requirements and expectations through the Sprint Planning and clear User Stories.</li>
<li><strong>Stakeholder Liaison</strong>: Acting as the primary link between stakeholders and the team, gathering feedback, and adjusting priorities accordingly.</li>
<li><strong>Defining the Vision</strong>: Articulating the product vision alone or with a Product Manager and ensuring it aligns with customer needs and company objectives.</li>
<li>Being <strong>Available</strong> to the development team:</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p>“The Product Owner has to be available to the team, to explain what needs to be done and why. (…) Often the team’s expertise will inform the decisions the Product Owner needs to make. The Product Owner has to be <span style="color: tomato">reliable, consistent, and available</span>. (…) They (the team) rely on the Product Owner for <span style="color: tomato">‘the vision’</span> and, also, <span style="color: tomato">market intelligence</span> on what is important.”</p>
</blockquote></div>
<div><h3 id="collaborative-dynamics">Collaborative Dynamics</h3><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Interaction Between Roles</strong>: The Product Owner defines what needs to be built, the Development Team determines how to build it, and the Scrum Master facilitates the process, ensuring effective collaboration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Unified Goals</strong>: Despite different focuses, all three roles (PO, Scrum Master, and Development Team) aim to deliver maximum value to the customer and continuously improve team efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication Flow</strong>: Regular interactions among the roles ensure transparency, quick feedback loops, and the ability to adapt to changes rapidly.</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div><p>Now that you have the basics of Scrum — its terminology, its way of thinking — here is a paragraph of the book that sums up Scrum well:</p><blockquote>
<p>“Scrum embraces <span style="color: tomato">uncertainty and creativity</span>. It places a <span style="color: tomato">structure around the learning process</span>, enabling teams to assess both what (the team) has created and, just as important, how they created it. (…) At its root, Scrum is based on a simple idea: <span style="color: tomato">whenever you start a project, why not regularly check in, see if what you’re doing is heading in the right direction, and if it’s actually what people want</span>? And question whether there are any ways to improve how you’re doing what you’re doing, any ways of doing it better and faster, and what might be keeping you from doing that. That’s what’s called an <span style="color: tomato">“Inspect and Adapt” cycle</span>. Every little while, stop doing what you’re doing, review what you’ve done, and see if it’s still what you should be doing and how you might do it better. <span style="color: tomato">It’s a simple idea, but executing it requires thought, introspection, honesty, and discipline.</span>”</p>
</blockquote><p>Now, I would like to finish this article by describing how I perceived this book and try to unveil some of the limits of Scrum.
