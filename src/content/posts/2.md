In our previous article, we highlighted Astro's potential advantages over other frameworks. This time, we set out to verify those claims by conducting a performance comparison between Astro, React, and Next.js. We built identical simple portfolio projects using each framework to see how they perform in terms of build times, deployment durations, and web page performance. By the end of this article, you'll understand how Astro performs compared to React and Next.js in various aspects and why it might be the right choice for your next project.
Experiment Setup

To ensure a fair comparison, we created identical portfolio websites using:

* React: Created with Create React App version 5.0.1
* Next.js: Version 13.4.0
* Astro: Version 2.10.15

Each portfolio contains a few pages with the same structure:
* A landing page with a logo
* An image
* Some text content

We used a MacBook Pro M1 (2021) for local builds and deployed the projects on Vercel to measure deployment durations.

## The Results

### Build Time Comparison
| Framework    | Local Build Time   | Deployment Time   |
|:------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|
| **Astro**    | 8.9s               | 29s               |
| **React**    | 11.5s              | 34s               |
| **Next.js**  | 14s                | 37s               |


As you can see, Astro performs better than React and Next.js concerning local build duration and online deployment. How about web page performance?

For the performance metrics, we used WebPageTest and configured it to simulate a Motorola G4 with 4G bandwidth:

### Initial Performance Metrics

| Metric                        | Astro    | Next.js | React  | 
|:-----------------------------:|:--------:|:-------:|:------:|
| **Number of Requests**        | 12       | 20      | 14     | 
| **Time to First Byte (TTFB)** | 0.82s    | 0.75s   | 0.73s  | 
| **Speed Index**               | 1.7s     | 1.9s    | 2.5s   | 
| **Page Weight**               | 1,791kb  | 347kb   | 1,832kb| 

From these metrics, our first attempt shows that Astro is better in local build time, deployment, number of requests to get the assets (CSS, JS, images, etc.), and page speed. However, looking at the details, we see that Astro's Time to First Byte and page weight are significantly higher than what Next.js achieves.
Upon examining the largest downloaded assets, we discovered that Next.js performed better because of its image optimization techniques, especially the use of its <Image /> component, which is strongly recommended by the framework. On the other hand, Astro does not automatically optimize images, causing your pages to have larger sizes than expected. In other words, you need to handle image optimization manually to use the Astro framework efficiently and improve your page size.
After addressing this issue by implementing image optimization in Astro, we obtained better results than Next.js, even in terms of page size:

### Performance Metrics After Image Optimization

| Metric                       | Astro (initial)    | Next.js | React  | Astro (optimized) |
|:-----------------------------|:------------------:|:-------:|:------:|:-----------------:|
| **Number of Requests**       | 12                 | 20      | 14     | 12                |
| **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**| 0.82s              | 0.75s   | 0.73s  | 0.72s             |
| **Speed Index**              | 1.7s               | 1.9s    | 2.5s   | 1.8s              |
| **Page Weight**              | 1,791kb            | 347kb   | 1,832kb| 306kb             |

In other words, Astro performs better on all tested dimensions: from deployment to page performance. With that in mind, we can raise the question: How is that possible? What makes Astro perform better than both React and Next.js? And why should you consider using Astro for small-scale projects such as your portfolio or company communication websites?

## Understanding Rendering Strategies

In the world of web development, presenting a webpage to a user and creating interactivity can be achieved through two major architectural styles: Client-Side Rendering (CSR) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

CSR, often associated with traditional React applications, pushes the responsibility of building the webpage entirely to the browser. The server sends a minimal HTML shell, and the browser downloads and runs JavaScript to build the page’s structure and interactivity on the fly.
In some cases, CSR can lead to sending large bundles of JavaScript, including code that might not even be used immediately (or ever) by the users. This can make the initial loading experience significantly slow because the browser has to do all the heavy lifting to build the page from scratch, potentially wasting energy and resources. This is precisely why React is heavier and slower than Next.js and Astro in our basic example.

### Back to the (U)SSR

In contrast, Server-Side Rendering (SSR), used by modern frameworks like Next.js and Astro, shifts much of this work back to the server, similar to how PHP operates. The server pre-renders the HTML, sending a fully-formed page to the browser. This allows the content to load quickly, with JavaScript stepping in afterward to hydrate the page and make it interactive.
This balance between speed and interactivity makes SSR frameworks great for performance, which is precisely why both Next.js and Astro perform better than React. Now the question is: What differs between Next.js and Astro that would explain why Astro performs slightly better than Next.js?

### Astro’s Selective Hydration and Island Architecture

Astro differs from Next.js in one key aspect: Zero JavaScript by default. This means that Astro sends no JavaScript to the browser unless it's necessary. Only the parts of your page that require interactivity are enhanced with JavaScript, and the rest remains static, making the page lighter and faster than Next.js. This concept is known as island architecture or selective hydration.
In contrast, Next.js hydrates the entire page, even for static sites generated at build time. This results in a larger JavaScript payload being sent to the client, which can impact performance.

## Should We All Favor Astro?

As you've experienced, Astro performs better than React and Next.js in our tests. The framework has much more to offer:
* Simple Developer Experience: Astro provides an intuitive development environment.
* Multi-Framework Support: It allows you to use components from other frameworks directly within Astro (React, Vue, Svelte, Preact, etc.).
* Optimized for Static Content: Astro excels in delivering static sites efficiently.

Our conclusion is that Astro is an excellent choice for developing simple projects or deploying websites where the internet connection of your users may be unreliable or slow. Its performance benefits and developer-friendly features make it a compelling option for modern web development.
