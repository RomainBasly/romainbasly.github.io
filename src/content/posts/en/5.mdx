In the two last articles, we spend some time explaining the origins of the framework and how it works in the details. In this article, we will focus more on our perception of the framework and describe some limits.

## A compelling framework with a strong philosophy

<div>
What truly captivated me about *The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time* is not just the mechanics of Scrum, but the profound positive philosophy depicted by the author. At its core, Scrum is about fostering a positive environment where teams are empowered to achieve greatness beyond individual capabilities. As he points out, applied correctly, Scrum teams can gather a lot of energy and passion at the same time:

> “When a team starts to align and synchronize, it can seem magical. You feel it when you walk into a room with them. You see it as they take the field. They look as if they’re floating; they’ve become greater than themselves. (…) It’s not impossible. It’s not only the elites and athletes and special people who can do this (achieve greatness). It’s about setting up the right framework with the right incentives and giving people the freedom, respect, and authority to do things themselves. Greatness can’t be imposed; it has to come from within. But it does live within all of us.”
</div>

### Trust

<div>
A fundamental aspect of this philosophy is trust. Scrum advocates for trusting the team entirely—respecting each member as a master of their craft. Empowerment isn't just about assigning responsibilities; it's about giving teams the autonomy and authority to make decisions, encouraging innovation, and fostering a sense of ownership.
</div>

### Shifting Away from Blame Culture

<div>
Another cornerstone is the shift away from blame culture to a develop-test-learn-adapt short cycle. Instead of seeking individuals to fault when things go mad, Scrum encourages teams to view challenges as systemic issues. This approach is rooted in avoiding the "Fundamental Attribution Error," recognizing that problems often arise from processes rather than people. By focusing on solutions collectively, teams can address root causes and continuously improve.
</div>

### Happiness

<div>
Happiness also plays a surprisingly central role in Scrum. Jeff Sutherland underscores that happier people are more productive, creative, and engaged. Scrum incorporates simple practices to evaluate and enhance team happiness, such as asking team members how they feel about their work and what could make them happier in the next sprint. This focus not only boosts morale but also drives better outcomes.

> “Here’s how it works. At the end of each Sprint each person on the team answers just a few questions:
> 1. On a scale from 1 to 5, how do you feel about your role in the company?
> 2. On the same scale, how do you feel about the company as a whole?
> 3. Why do you feel that way?
> 4. What one thing would make you happier in the next Sprint?
> That’s it. It can be done in just a few minutes. Every person on the team takes a turn, and it sparks really insightful conversations. Together the team usually comes up with a kaizen quite quickly. The method exposes what is most important to each team member, and what they think is most important for the company.
> And here’s the crucial piece. The team takes that one top improvement and makes it the most important thing to do in the next Sprint—with acceptance tests. How can you prove you’ve made that improvement? You need to define what success is in a concrete, actionable way, so that in the next Sprint Retrospective it’s really easy to see if you achieved the kaizen.”
</div>

### Transparency

<div>
In Scrum, Transparency is paramount. In an ideal Scrum environment, information flows openly. There are no hidden agendas or secret plans. This openness builds trust and ensures that everyone is aligned with the team's goals and the organization's mission. When people understand how their work contributes to the bigger picture, it fosters a deeper connection and commitment.

> “One element of Scrum that’s often a prelude to achieving autonomy, mastery, and purpose is transparency. The idea is that there should be no secret cabal, no hidden agendas, nothing behind the curtain. (…) So in Scrum (his company), everything is visible. In my companies, every salary, every financial, every expenditure is available to everyone. I’ve never understood why anyone would want to keep this stuff secret except to further their own individual agenda, or to keep people infantilized. I want the administrative assistant to be able to read the profit-and-loss statement and to understand precisely how what he does contributes to that. I want everyone in the company to be aligned with a unified purpose. Atomizing people into informational silos simply slows everyone down. Plus, it breeds suspicion and distrust. It divides a company into the big boys who know stuff and the peons who merely execute segments of some mysterious agenda they aren’t capable of understanding.”
</div>

### Work-Life Balance
<div>
Scrum means finding a way to become more productive as a team, but it does not equate to necessarily working more hours. This idea can go against a lot of mentalities where presenteeism is perceived as a sign of dedication and is deeply rooted in some workers' minds:

> “At that time OpenView was like a lot of high-powered offices. Ingrained in the corporate culture was the expectation that people would work late and on the weekends. These were aggressive, ambitious people. But they were getting burned out, depressed, and demoralized. It was such a tough environment that some people couldn’t take it and quit.
> But as the firm’s teams started working with Scrum, Scott noticed a shift in productivity. Working more hours stopped producing more output. (…)
> He started telling people that working late wasn’t a sign of commitment; it was a sign of failure. ‘It’s not because I want you to have a balanced life,’ he told people. ‘It’s because you’ll get more stuff done. (…)’
> So no more nights, no more weekends.”
</div>

### Adhering to the Spirit of Scrum

<div>
Finally, one of the most crucial elements is adhering to the original spirit of Scrum. It's not just about following practices mechanically, performing ceremonies as if they would trigger positivity and productivity like a magic wand, but embracing the underlying values of respect, courage, focus, openness, and commitment. Without this, Scrum can become a hollow framework, failing to deliver its transformative potential.
</div>

## Recognizing the limitations

<div>
While Scrum offers a powerful framework for enhancing team performance, it's not without its challenges. One limitation is the misconception that Scrum requires minimal or no documentation. While Scrum emphasizes working software over comprehensive documentation, certain projects—especially those with long-term maintenance considerations—may benefit from well-maintained documentation to onboard new team members and preserve institutional knowledge.
</div>
<div>

Scrum also assumes a certain level of team maturity and cohesion. It requires team members who are not only skilled but also possess the emotional intelligence to collaborate effectively, handle feedback constructively, and commit to collective goals over individual agendas.

> “At the same time, people have to have the fortitude to bring up the issues that are really bothering them in a way that is solution-oriented rather than accusatory. And the rest of the team has to have the maturity to hear the feedback, take it in, and look for a solution rather than get defensive.”
</div>

<div>
Moreover, the effectiveness of Scrum heavily relies on the abilities of the Scrum Master and Product Owner. As we read Jeff Sutherland, we soon understand how charismatic he is and his capacity to lead teams. However, not every organization has leaders who can embody the servant-leader role that Scrum advocates. Without strong guidance rooted in Scrum's philosophy, teams might struggle to fully realize the framework’s benefits.
</div>
<div>
Another consideration is the intensity of continuous sprints. Not all projects demand or can sustain such a pace indefinitely. Teams may need to incorporate pauses or adjust sprint cadences to prevent unhappiness and burnout from emerging. While one of Jeff Sutherland’s greatest challenges is to push people to continue improving their productivity, what if, after a certain period, a threshold prevents the team from performing better? Because they simply cannot go higher?

</div>
<div>
Lastly, while setting audacious goals can inspire and drive teams to new heights, it's essential to find the right balance between ambition and realism. Goals should stretch the team but remain attainable. Overcommitting can lead to repeated failures, diminishing morale, and undermining trust in the Scrum process.
</div>

## Conclusion

<div>
The Scrum framework is a great tool, built by a brilliant leader, and it has inspired a lot of teams. Going straight to the point, removing all that is superfluous, tackling well-being at work, empowering people, pushing boundaries, and learning something new in every sprint, we now understand—reading this book—why this framework has gained so much traction in Western economies and in tech companies. And we are perfectly able to see why it can create a strong energy and passion around a project.
</div>
<div>
Nevertheless, applying the Scrum framework cannot solve all the problematic situations that can happen in the normal course of a company’s lifetime (for example: making everything a priority, having a misalignment between high management and the Product Owner in their perception of what the market needs—because they were unavailable in the first place—or making conflicting priorities between two services to the team). However, if a company wants to invest in teams working within the Scrum framework, it goes without saying that it is not only the framework and rituals that need to be applied but rather an entire philosophy centered around the empowerment of both the individuals and the teams. That is the real key to success.
