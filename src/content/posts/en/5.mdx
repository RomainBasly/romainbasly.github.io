In the last two articles, we spent time exploring the origins of the framework and detailing how it works. In this article, we will focus more on our perception of the framework and describe some limits.

## A compelling framework with a strong philosophy

<div>
What truly captivated me about *The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time* is not just the mechanics of Scrum, but the profound positive philosophy depicted by the author. At its core, Scrum fosters a positive environment that empowers teams to accomplish more than individuals can achieve alone. As he points out, applied correctly, Scrum teams can gather a lot of energy and passion at the same time:

> “When a team starts to align and synchronize, it can seem <span style="color: tomato">magical</span>. You feel it when you walk into a room with them. You see it as they take the field. They look as if they’re floating; <span style="color: tomato">they’ve become greater than themselves</span>. (…) It’s not impossible. It’s not only the elites and athletes and special people who can do this (achieve greatness). It’s about setting up the right framework with the right incentives and giving people the freedom, respect, and authority to do things themselves. **<span style="color: tomato">Greatness can’t be imposed; it has to come from within. But it does live within all of us</span>**.”
</div>

### Trust

<div>
A fundamental aspect of this philosophy is trust. Scrum advocates for trusting the team entirely — respecting each member as a master of their craft. Empowerment isn't just about assigning responsibilities; it's about giving teams the autonomy and authority to make decisions, encouraging innovation, and fostering a sense of ownership.
</div>

### Shifting Away from Blame Culture

<div>
Another cornerstone is the shift away from a blame culture, embracing a short cycle of developing, testing, learning, and adapting. Instead of seeking individuals to fault when things go wrong, Scrum encourages teams to view challenges as systemic issues. This approach is rooted in avoiding the "Fundamental Attribution Error," recognizing that problems often arise from processes rather than people. By focusing on solutions collectively, teams can address root causes and continuously improve.
</div>

### Happiness

<div>
Happiness also plays a surprisingly central role in Scrum. Jeff Sutherland underscores that happier people are more productive, creative, and engaged. Scrum incorporates simple practices to evaluate and enhance team happiness, such as asking team members how they feel about their work and what could make them happier in the next sprint. This focus not only boosts morale but also drives better outcomes.

> “Here’s how it works. At the end of each Sprint each person on the team answers just a few questions:
> 1. On a scale from 1 to 5, how do you feel about your role in the company?
> 2. On the same scale, how do you feel about the company as a whole?
> 3. Why do you feel that way?
> 4. What one thing would make you happier in the next Sprint?

> "That’s it. It can be done in just a few minutes. Every person on the team takes a turn, and it sparks really insightful conversations. Together the team usually comes up with a kaizen quite quickly. The method exposes what is most important to each team member, and what they think is most important for the company.
> And here’s the crucial piece. The team takes that one top improvement and makes it the most important thing to do in the next Sprint—with acceptance tests. How can you prove you’ve made that improvement? You need to define what success is in a concrete, actionable way, so that in the next Sprint Retrospective it’s really easy to see if you achieved the kaizen.”
</div>

### Transparency

<div>
In Scrum, Transparency is paramount. In an ideal Scrum environment, information flows openly. There are no hidden agendas or secret plans. This openness builds trust and ensures that everyone is aligned with the team's goals and the organization's mission. When people understand how their work contributes to the bigger picture, it fosters a deeper connection and commitment.

> “One element of Scrum that’s often a prelude to achieving autonomy, mastery, and purpose is transparency. The idea is that there should be no secret cabal, no hidden agendas, nothing behind the curtain. (…) So in Scrum (his company), everything is visible. In my companies, every salary, every financial, every expenditure is available to everyone. I’ve never understood why anyone would want to keep this stuff secret except to further their own individual agenda, or to keep people infantilized. I want the administrative assistant to be able to read the profit-and-loss statement and to understand precisely how what he does contributes to that. <span style="color: tomato">I want everyone in the company to be aligned with a unified purpose</span>. Atomizing people into informational silos simply slows everyone down. Plus, it breeds suspicion and distrust. It divides a company into the big boys who know stuff and the peons who merely execute segments of some mysterious agenda they aren’t capable of understanding.”
</div>

### Work-Life Balance
<div>
Scrum means finding a way to become more productive as a team, but it does not equate to necessarily working more hours. This idea can go against a lot of mentalities where presenteeism is perceived as a sign of dedication and is deeply rooted in some workers' minds:

> “At that time OpenView was like a lot of high-powered offices. Ingrained in the corporate culture was the expectation that people would work late and on the weekends. These were aggressive, ambitious people. But they were getting burned out, depressed, and demoralized. It was such a tough environment that some people couldn’t take it and quit.
> But as the firm’s teams started working with Scrum, Scott noticed a shift in productivity. Working more hours stopped producing more output. (…)
> He started telling people that working late wasn’t a sign of commitment; it was a sign of failure. ‘It’s not because I want you to have a balanced life,’ he told people...”
</div>

### Adhering to the Spirit of Scrum

<div>
Finally, one of the most crucial elements is adhering to the original spirit of Scrum. It's not just about following practices mechanically, performing ceremonies as if they would trigger positivity and productivity like a **magic wand**, but embracing the underlying values of **respect, courage, focus, openness, transparency and commitment**. Without this, Scrum can become a hollow framework, failing to deliver its transformative potential.
</div>

## Recognizing the limitations

While Scrum offers a powerful framework for enhancing team performance, it's not without its challenges and limitations. One common misconception is that Scrum requires minimal or no documentation. 
<div>

### Documentation

While applying Scrum does prioritize working software over comprehensive documentation, some teams simply get rid of the documentation due to lack of time, leading to potential inefficiencies. For instance, creating a simple diagram at the outset to map workflows can save significant time later. Without this initial step, teams risk navigating blindly, making errors, and losing time trying to correct their course. Taking a step back to reflect on the architecture from the beginning — not just choosing it, but understanding why it’s being chosen — and involving the entire team in this process can provide long-term clarity and direction.
</div>
<div>
Similarly, comments explaining the purpose of major functions within a codebase can be invaluable. In more complex systems, these annotations help team members — current and future—understand the intent behind the code, enabling them to navigate and maintain the codebase more efficiently.
By integrating these practices and finding the right balance in documentation, teams can achieve agility, ensure immediate progress, ease the onboarding of new members, and support long-term scalability.


</div>
<span style="color: tomato">Question</span> : **What is for you the right level of documentation for a team?**
<div>
### Homogeneity of the team
Scrum also assumes a certain level of team maturity and cohesion. It requires team members who are not only skilled but also possess the emotional intelligence to collaborate effectively, handle feedback constructively, and commit to collective goals over individual agendas.

> “At the same time, people have to have the fortitude to bring up the issues that are really bothering them in a way that is solution-oriented rather than accusatory. And the rest of the team has to have the maturity to hear the feedback, take it in, and look for a solution rather than get defensive.”
</div>

<div>
<span style="color: tomato">Question</span> : **What do you do to ensure that a team is well-balanced and stay cohesive, in your own team?**
</div>
<div>

### Having a charismatic Product Owner and/or Scrum Master
Moreover, the effectiveness of Scrum heavily relies on the abilities of the Product Owner and/or Scrum Master. 
As we read Jeff Sutherland, we soon understand how charismatic he is and his capacity to lead teams. However, not every organization has leaders who can embody the servant-leader role that Scrum advocates. Without strong guidance rooted in Scrum's philosophy, teams might struggle to fully realize the framework’s benefits.
And some teams might not have a Scrum master per se, meaning that a Product Owner or a Scrum Master might have two hats, which can be fine. However, having two separate people for two distinct needs (business for the PO, servant-leader and happiness officer for a Scrum Master) might be a good practice to ensure everyone is aligned and well inside the team.
</div>

<span style="color: tomato">Question</span> : **In your team, do you have a separate Scrum Master and Product Owner?**

<div>
### Scrum as magic recipe for all Situations?
As we see it every day in the job market, Agile Methodologies and Scrum are praised and more and more companies would like to shift the Scrum Framework. Indeed, Scrum is particularly suited for creating something new or modernizing something - such as building new products, features or refactoring existing systems. 
However, **Scrum is not a one-size-fits-all framework**. It may fall short in scenarios where:

* Teams **do not create** or build anything new and are instead focused on the **maintenance phase** (run) of the project.  
* The work involves **managing multiple priorities** across several projects simultaneously.  
* The majority of the work consists of **communication, coordination, or constant interactions**, with little opportunity to focus on actual development.  



</div>
Scrum is a framework designed for **building, innovating, and refining**. It is less effective for handling day-to-day operational activities, situations where team members are scattered across various unrelated tasks or the focus is scattered accross many different topics. In such contexts, other management methods may be more appropriate.

<span style="color: tomato">Question</span> : **In which context, according to you, Scrum Framework works as intented? Or does not work as intended?**
<div>

### Missing Motivation and Happiness 
Jeff Sutherland highlights that happiness and motivation are essential for Scrum teams to thrive. These factors are not just beneficial but crucial for success in a Scrum environment. Without addressing them upfront, even the best Scrum Master or Product Owner, combined with well-executed rituals, will fail to unlock the team's full productivity potential.
To implement Scrum effectively, it’s essential to first assess the team’s motivation and emotional well-being. By addressing concerns and boosting team energy, you establish a solid foundation for successful sprints and long-term productivity.
</div>
<span style="color: tomato">Question</span> : **What did you set inside your team to ensure that everyone remains strongly committed on the long run?**

<div>
### Balancing Pace and Performance Limits
Another important consideration is the intensity of continuous sprints. Not all projects require or can sustain such a relentless pace over time. To prevent unhappiness and burnout, teams may need to adjust sprint cadences or incorporate pauses. Jeff Sutherland emphasizes the importance of continuously pushing teams to improve productivity, but what happens when they hit a natural threshold? After a certain point, a team may find it impossible to improve further simply because they’ve already reached their peak capacity.
</div>

<span style="color: tomato">Question</span> : **Do you keep pushing constantly for more progress inside your team? And how do you do it?**

## Conclusion

<div>
The Scrum framework is a great tool, built by a brilliant leader, and it has inspired a lot of teams. Going straight to the point, removing all that is superfluous, tackling well-being at work, empowering people, pushing boundaries, and learning something new in every sprint, we now understand—reading this book—why this framework has gained so much traction in Western economies and in tech companies. And I am perfectly able to see why it can create a strong energy and passion around a project which needs to create something new.
</div>
<div>
Nevertheless, applying the Scrum framework is no magic wand and cannot resolve every challenge a company may face during its operations (for example: some people are tempted to make everything a priority, having a misalignment between high management and the Product Owner in their perception of what the market needs — or having conflicting priorities between two services to the team and the Product Owner cannot decide which one is the most important). And for a company to successfully implement Scrum, it must go beyond the framework and rituals, embracing a philosophy of empowering teams are the real keys to success.
