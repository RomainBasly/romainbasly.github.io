In our previous article, we highlighted **Astro's potential advantages over other frameworks**. This time, we set out to verify those claims by conducting a performance comparison between **Astro**, **React**, and **Next.js**. We built identical simple portfolio projects using each framework to see how they perform in terms of **build times**, **deployment durations**, and **web page performance**. By the end of this article, you'll understand how **Astro performs compared to React and Next.js** in various aspects and why it might be the right choice for your next project.

## Experiment Setup

<div>
To ensure a fair comparison, we created identical portfolio websites using:
* **React**: Created with Create React App version 5.0.1
* **Next.js**: Version 13.4.0
* **Astro**: Version 2.10.15
</div>

<div>
Each portfolio contains a few pages with the same structure:
* **A landing page with a logo**
* **An image**
* **Some text content**
</div>

We used a **MacBook Pro M1 (2021)** for local builds and deployed the projects on **Vercel** to measure deployment durations.

## The Results

### Build Time Comparison

| Framework    | Local Build Time   | Deployment Time   |
|:------------:|:------------------:|:-----------------:|
| **Astro**    | **8.9s**           | **29s**           |
| **React**    | 11.5s              | 34s               |
| **Next.js**  | 14s                | 37s               |

As you can see, **Astro performs better than React and Next.js in terms of local build duration and online deployment**. How about **web page performance**?

For the performance metrics, we used **WebPageTest** and configured it to simulate a **Motorola G4** with **4G bandwidth**:

### Initial Performance Metrics

| Metric                        | **Astro**   | **Next.js** | **React**   | 
|:------------------------------|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| **Number of Requests**        | **12**      | **20**      | **14**      | 
| **Time to First Byte (TTFB)** | **0.82s**   | **0.75s**   | **0.73s**   | 
| **Speed Index - First Visit** | **2.0s**    | **1.7s**    | **2.3s**    | 
| **Speed Index - Second Visit**| **1.7s**    | **1.5s**    | **2.0s**    | 
| **Page Weight - First Visit** | **1,791kB** | **347kB**   | **1,832kB** | 
| **Page Weight - Second Visit**| **6kB**     | **10kB**    | **1,832kB** | 

<div>
From these metrics, we can draw **three conclusions**:

- **Astro's build folder is significantly smaller**: 9MB vs React's 17MB and Next.js's 314MB.
- **Astro outperforms React and Next.js** in local build time, deployment, and number of requests to fetch assets (CSS, JS, images, etc.).
- However, **Astro's initial performance metrics show higher TTFB, page weight, and Speed Index compared to Next.js**.
</div>

<div>
### Addressing Astro's Initial Page Weight Issue

Upon examining the largest downloaded assets, we discovered that **Next.js performed better due to its built-in image optimization techniques**, especially its **Image component**. **Astro requires manual image optimization**, leading to larger page sizes and slower speeds initially.
</div>

After implementing **image optimization (opt)** in Astro and in React (using Lazy Loading), the results improved significantly:

| Metric                        | **Astro (init)**    | **Next.js** | **React (Opt)**   | **Astro (Opt)**        |
|:------------------------------|:-------------------:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:----------------------:|
| **Number of Requests**        | 12                  | 20          | 13                | **12**                 |
| **Time to First Byte (TTFB)** | 0.82s               | 0.75s       | 0.73s             | **0.72s**              |
| **Speed Index - First Visit** | 2.0s                | 1.7s        | 2.4s              | **1.8s**               |
| **Speed Index - Second Visit**| 1.7s                | 1.5s        | 2.4s              | **0.8s**               |
| **Page Weight - First Visit** | 1,791kB             | 347kB       | 280kB             | **306kB**              |
| **Page Weight - Second Visit**| **6kB**             | 10kB        | 280kB             | **0kB**                |

With optimized images, **Astro performs better than React and Next.js across all dimensions** (except for Speed Index - First Visit), including deployment, page performance, and project size. The question we can raise is : why do we witness such significant differences between the frameworks? For that, we need to dig deeper into their rendering strategies.

## Understanding rendering strategies
In modern web development, there are several rendering strategies to present webpages and handle interactivity:

<div>
### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
CSR, often associated with traditional React applications, pushes the responsibility of building the webpage entirely to the browser. The server sends a minimal HTML shell, and the browser downloads and runs JavaScript to build the page’s structure and interactivity on the fly.
In some cases, CSR can lead to sending large bundles of JavaScript, including code that might not even be used immediately (or ever) by the users. This can make the initial loading experience significantly slow because the browser has to do all the heavy lifting to build the page from scratch, potentially wasting energy and resources. This is precisely why React is heavier and slower than Next.js and Astro in our basic example.
</div>

<div>
### Back to the (U)SSR
In contrast, Server-Side Rendering (SSR), used by modern frameworks like Next.js and Astro, shifts much of this work back to the server, similar to how PHP operates. The server pre-renders the HTML, sending a fully-formed page to the browser. This allows the content to load quickly with JavaScript stepping in afterward to hydrate the page and make it interactive.
This balance between speed and interactivity makes SSR frameworks great for performance, which is precisely why both Next.js and Astro perform better than React. 
</div>
<div>
### Static Site Generation (SSG)
Another rendering strategy is using Static Site Generation (SSG): the HTML pages are generated at build time, pre-rendered as static HTML files and then served to the browser by the server. In return, it allows you to have fast performance webpages and fewer resources consumption. In our case, Astro and Next.js use SSG by default.
</div>

<div>
### Hybrid Approaches
Frameworks like Next.js and Astro support hybrid rendering strategies, allowing developers to choose the most appropriate method for each page or component. With Next.js 13+'s server components and Astro's island architecture, developers can build highly optimized websites by serving static content and hydrating only necessary interactive components.
</div>

## What makes Astro different : Selective Hydration and Island Architecture

<div>
> “I love water, in 20 or 30 years there won’t be any more.” 
> (Jean Claude Van Damme)

Astro stands out from Next.js with its **default approach of sending zero JavaScript** to the browser. In Astro, only the components that require interactivity are enhanced with JavaScript, a process known as **selective hydration**. This is part of the "island architecture", where each component operates as a separate "island," and you decide which component needs Javascript hydration for user interactions. 

This method keeps pages lightweight and significantly improves performance by reducing the JavaScript payload.

Similarly, recent versions of Next.js (13+) introduced the app directory and Server Components, allowing developers to render components on the server without sending JavaScript to the client. While this aligns with Astro’s approach, our tests found that building a simple static site with Next.js resulted in **longer build times and larger bundle sizes** compared to Astro, despite its efficient handling of static content.

</div>

## Why Choose Astro?

<div>
Astro **excels** in delivering **static content with simplicity**:
- **Minimal Build Size**: Astro's build outputs are leaner compared to Next.js.
- **Faster Build Times**: Optimized for static sites.
- **Better for Simple Projects**: Ideal for portfolios or content-focused sites.
</div>

## Should We All Favor Astro for All Websites?

In our tests, **Astro performed exceptionally well**, especially after image optimization. 
However, depending on your needs, both React and Next.js 13+ offer features that may better suit larger or more dynamic projects.

## When choose React?
<div>
Created by a Facebook engineer, React is a frontend framework developed to build Single Page Applications (SPA) for dynamic and high-performing user interfaces. Around the creation of a Virtual DOM and the modular Programming, React is specifically designed for:
* projects that may grow in complexity and that can benefit from the modular architecture
* modern and complex applications dealing with a lot of information (text, messages, images, videos, Instant messaging...). 
* projects that may expand to mobile apps cross platform (iOs, Android), turning the project later into a react native app
</div>

## When choose Next.js?

<div>
Next.js is a framework that addresses some of the main challenges of using React for client-side rendering (CSR), such as SEO optimization, static webpage creation, and the lack of built-in routing: 
* Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG): Next.js simplifies the implementation of SSR and SSG, which enhances performance and scalability.
* Search Engine Optimization: as the page is rendered during build (SSG) or during client request (SSR), the client receives a page optimized for SEO purposes.
* File-System Routing: no need to rely on an external library, Next.js creates directly a route based on the architecture of the pages/ or app/ folder (depending on the version and the chosen architecture)
</div>
For advanced applications requiring dynamic capabilities, **Next.js remains a strong contender**.

## Conclusion
<div>
Ultimately, the choice between Astro, React, and Next.js depends on your project's specific needs:
* Choose Astro for **content-focused** sites where **performance and simplicity** are highest priorities.
* Select Next.js for a more complex app, if you require server-side rendering, SEO optimization, and a robust framework that enhances React's capabilities for larger applications.
* Consider React when you need **flexibility** and plan to build highly interactive interfaces or **expand to mobile platforms**.
